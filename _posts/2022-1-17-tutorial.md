## Using GeoPandas to Plot and Manipulate Geographic Data

GeoPandas is a python library for dealing with geographic and spatial data. Rather than using multiple libraries in order to import, clean, and plot this type of data, GeoPandas bundles all this functionality for a more seamless experience. In this tutorial, I'll show how to get a basic notebook up and running with GeoPandas.

#### Why use GeoPandas?
Much of the functionality available in GeoPandas could be accomplished by employing CartoPy, Pandas, and GeoPy. Unsurprisingly, those last two are dependencies of GeoPandas (though I believe GeoPy is optional). As the name might imply, GeoPandas primarily is set up to use and mimic Pandas to deal with data, most exemplified by GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame being subclasses of the equivalently named Pandas structures. Effectively this gives all the power and versatility of dealing with data in Pandas, without needing to add in different conversions beforehand.
