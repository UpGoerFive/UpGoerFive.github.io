Hello! My name is Nathaniel and I'm a Data Science student at Flatiron School currently.
I come from a music background and am looking forward to moving into a more technical space.
I'll do my best to string words together in a (somewhat) coherent fashion on this blog, but no promises! I am a [violist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_jokes) after all.
